                <p class="font-weight-light">
                    I grew up in Bremen, Germany, in a family of book-crazy women. My career in advertising brought me to New York City in my early twenties. After working for several large ad agencies in the city, I left the rat race to be home with my three spirited (read:
                    loud and strong-willed) children. Being a full-time mom is the best job in the world. It’s also the hardest and not always the most fulfilling. Then a magical thing happened: I discovered my love for writing. And over the course of
                    a couple of life-changing years, I wrote my first novel, Only Child.
                </p>
                <p class="font-weight-light">
                    I can’t believe I get to share it with you now! Only Child has been published by Knopf here in the U.S. and by Mantle in the U.K.. It will also be published in many countries around the world and translated into sixteen other languages. I can’t wait for
                    you to read it.
